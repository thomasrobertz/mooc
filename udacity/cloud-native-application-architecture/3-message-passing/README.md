# Message Passing Exercises
This repo contains the code for demos, exercises, and exercise solutions.

This repository organizes the code by the lessons that they are used in. Each set of code is located in their respective lessons. The code for each respective lesson is set up as a directory which is its own distinct project.

## Example:
All lesson 1 files are in `/lesson-1-refactoring-from-a-monolith/`.

This directory contains: `udacredit-monolith-solution/`, `udacredit-monolith-starter`, and `udacredit-monolith`. Each one of these directories is its own distinct project so everything that is needed for the project to run is self-contained in its directory.
