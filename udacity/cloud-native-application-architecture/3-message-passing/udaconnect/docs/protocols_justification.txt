Justification for each protocol strategy.

Kafka
-----
Since Kafka lends itself well to event-driven architectures, I decided to use it in this project for a similar task.
In a later phase of the project I decided to decompose the connection service further and
implement it to support parallel operation (Scatter-Gather).
Now we are also future proof in this area, because Kafka scales extremely well, and so we will be able to 
handle a lot more geo data easily, should the need arise.
Furthermore, as a stretch goal, I use Kafka to provide an event-based, centralized logging endpoint.

-> Kafka is used for:
-Geolocation Compute.
-Centralized Logging.


gRPC
----
gRPC is a good fit for inter-service communications in a microservice architecture.
Unlike our use of ReST, we use the gRPC protocol more for internal tasks.
While the frontend may be more prone to changes as we include more and more feature requests, 
the internal models of Connection, Location and Person can be considered to be pretty stable. 
This way we also reap the benefit of gRPC communications being typed.
Lastly, we can rely on gRPC's performance for fast internal transfer speeds, helping us serve request with low response times.

-> gRPC is used for:
-Performing CRUD operations between microservices.


ReST
----
Rest is a standard that is used in most web-based applications, so it is a good choice for the more general implementations.
Unlike gRPC and Kafka operations, which can be seen as geared more towards internal operations, ReST in this 
application is more upstream oriented, towards the customer and the presentation layer.
Which makes sense from a design point of view, firstly because of the simplicity in design and implementation.
It is future proof because we can easily react to changing requirements.
New developers will be able to pick up the API easily and be able to work on a wide area of tasks.
Also ReST is typically used for CRUD operations.

-> ReST is used for:
-All web application endpoints.
