I had a rough start with quicksort because I thought I knew how it works but I confused it with merge sort.
So I looked online for some help, but found that some explanations confused me too.
Also I think you will find some "reference" implmentations that simply don't work.
I did manage to sort elements without repeating elements, but the full quicksort implementation is
a little more complicated. I found a good explanation on medium to rebuild the algorithm sucessfully.
